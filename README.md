# Challenge-Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

 The challenge was to create a portfolio show casing the HTML and CSS skills we have gained since joining the boot-camp, this challenge was an absolute treat to work on, from the imagination aspect to seeing the final product, Amazing. Although, that is not to say that this was not a difficult task, one of the hardest projects I have had in the web development space thus far, I learned many things but more importantly I learned what I needed to work on and that was my major take away. I struggled with margins and paddings and I am not hiding and I am sure you will see but for now I have done my best, and I am very proud of the web page that I have created.
